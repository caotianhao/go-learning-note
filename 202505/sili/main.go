// SILI Game Entry Point
//
// This is the starting program for a Go-based recreation of the classic dungeon adventure game SILI.
// SILI is a challenging and strategic tower-climbing game where players level up, collect equipment and items,
// and fight monsters to ultimately escape the maze and win.
//
// This project aims to implement the core gameplay and mechanics of SILI in Go,
// including character attributes, map design, battle system, and item system.
// The goal is to faithfully reproduce the gaming experience while providing a fun way to learn and practice Go.
//
// Contributions, testing, and discussions are welcome!
// Let's build an open-source version of SILI that brings fun and nostalgia to players.
//
// 네 눈 속에 가득 차 오르는 달빛!
// 소리 없이 고통 속에 흘러 넘치는 이 밤!
